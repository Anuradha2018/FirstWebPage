			<p>
				Welcome to the Bioanalytics research group!
			</p>
			<p>
				The Bioanalytics group employs micro- and nanotechnology, microfluidics and
				multi-parameter detection systems (both optical and electrochemical) for the
				development and characterization of integrated devices with applications in
				tissue engineering, drug delivery and monitoring biological processes at
				cellular level. With the use of 3D printing and other modern micro- and
				nanofabrication technologies, biomimetic membranes and 3D carbon scaffolds
				with promising applications in biology and medicine are being designed and
				tested as part of the interdisciplinary tasks that this group set out to accomplish.

      <h3>Bioimpedance based Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) systems using 3D printing</h3>
			<p>
				Recently rapid prototyping technology and in particular 3D printing technologies are
				increasingly being exploited for tissue engineering applications. The main challenge
				in tissue engineering organs is that the engineered organ must mimic the physiological
				function of the biological organ. 3D printing technology allows us to tailor the
				microarchitecture of scaffolds and particularly enables the possibility of developing
				high resolution channels to supply nutrients to cells. Additionally, this technology
				can be used to fabricate intelligent biochips and microfluidic systems incorporating
				scaffolds embedded with cells and electrodes for monitoring growth and proliferation
				of cells. The goal of this project is to optimize 3D printing technology for production
				of system components for a bioartificial liver on a chip system. This includes development
				of biochips, tissue engineering scaffolds and microfluidic system components. This project
				will be carried on in synergy with the EU funded NanoBio4Trans project whose overall aim is
				to engineer a highly vascularized artificial liver using a combination of stem cell,
				3D scaffold and micro-nano sensing technologies.<br>

               To facilitate measurements in a 3D cell culture system and eliminating the influence of the capacitive effects
              of electrode interface, specially adapted electrode systems will be designed and different electrode
              configurations will be exploited for both conventional impedance spectroscopy and impedance tomography applications

        <h3>Conducting pyrolysed 3D carbon scaffolds for cell replacement therapy</h3>
			<p>

				This project involves biological exploration of pyrolysed 3D carbon scaffold (p3D-CS) materials
				of different topography, porosity and conductivity. The biological background is stem cell research
				for Parkinson´s disease for which we in a recent study have shown that an SU8 derived p3D-CS (Fig 2)
				remarkably boosted the differentiation of human neuronal stem cells (hNSCs) into dopaminergic neurons
				(dopamine producing neurons), and that the scaffold moreover could be used to directly sense and confirm
				the dopaminergic phenotype of these neurons (Fig. 2). This PhD project intends to: (1) set up an analytical
				framework that will aid in obtaining a better understanding of the underlying mechanism for such previously
				unseen differentiation effects on any material, and (2) find new carbon materials and structures that can be
				explored for cell replacement therapy (CRT) and tissue engineering applications for the future.<br>

          <h3>Real-time monitoring of stem cell differentiation in brain tissue using microfluidics</h3>
            <p>
      Since the early 1960’s the treatment of PD has been based on medication supplying L-DOPA,
	  an intermediate of DA synthesis in functional cells, to alleviate the symptoms of the
	  impaired motor function. Although this treatment has shown positive effects, it only
	  relieves the symptoms in the early stage of PD without providing a long-term cure.
	  Translantation of dopaminergic neuronal stem cells (NSCs) (stem cell therapy) has become
	  a new possible long-term treatment. NSCs can integrate into the striatum, replenishing
	  the supply of dopamine, has been proposed as an alternative [2, 3].  In this project
	  stem cell therapy for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease is under focus. The main
	  goal is to establish a microfluidic online culture system with integrated electrodes
	  to characterize and optimize the differentiation of NSCs so that they function in the
	  same manner as native dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore the synaptic connections formed
	  between the differentiated NSCs and the primary neurons from striatum will be investigated.
	  In order to study the formation of synaptic connections between native neurons and neuronal
	  stem cells, there is a need for the establishment of a microfluidic platform with integrated
	  electrode chips where primary neurons from striatum can be co-cultured with NSCs. This type of
	  system can facilitate specific stimulation of neuronal stem cells and signal recording from the
	  co-cultured primary neurons. For the establishment of this experimental approach, there is the
	  need to optimize transfection of neuronal stem cells to enable optogenetic modification that allows
	  stimulation of the cells by using a specific wavelength of light. Fluorescence based detections will
	  be used to monitor influx of calcium in the neuronal stem cells during exocytosis event and molecular
	  beacon will be used to visualize mRNA appearance when tyrosine Hydroxylase is synthesized.  <br>
